Welcome to the page of my (W.I.P.) project called 

<img src="https://github.com/telepath9/ESPclock/blob/54c39c18d9204351de640fb42218651ce3664671/pics/newfont.png" alt="Alt Text" width="100%" height="100%">

which is a smart clock that connects to a NTP server to get the current time. 
It uses a ESP8266 (devboard: Wemos D1 mini, soon i will make it work also for ESP32).

After it has synced with NTP server for the first time, it can work also in OFFLINE mode (even without using RTC module, that was present in the older version, but then i removed in the v2.0).

<h2>📜 INSTRUCTIONS </h2>

1. Install VSCode or <b>VSCodium</b> (i prefer VSCodium because it basically is VSCode but <b>without</b> telemetry);

2. Install PIOarduino extension on VSCode/VSCodium;

3. Download the latest .zip file that you can find in the "Release" section, extract it, then open in VSCode/VSCodium the ESPclock project directory;

4. Select the PIOarduino extension in VSCode/VSCodium, then you have to store the html page into the esp8266 flash memory in two steps:
	1. Platform -> Build filesystem image
	2. Platform -> Upload filesystem image

5. Now lets upload the C/C++ code. Again from the PIOarduino extension in VSCode/VSCodium, go to:
	1. General -> Build
	2. General -> Upload

6. Now let's connect PC or mobile to the ESPclock access point, with the password: waltwhite64

7. After connecting to the ESPclock's AP, open your browser and paste in the address bar: http://192.168.4.1/

8. From the web UI, first add your home network, then the NTP server that matches your region, plus the GMT/UTC offset hour(s).

9. And we're done! Hope that you liked my project! If you have any suggestions, let me know!

<h2>🔌 ESP8266 WIRING (Wemos D1 Mini 3.0.0 devboard)</h2>

<h2>⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
There are (at the moment) two errors that can be displayed from the 7-segment display:
<ul>
<li>Err0 -> when "LittleFS.begin()" fails</li>
<li>Err1 -> when "index.html" doesn't exists in flash memory (user forgot to upload it)</li>
<li>Fake "Not connected" popup bug: i noticed that sometimes, after entering a correct password for an SSID, the popup says "Not connected" while, instead, esp8266 has succeed to connect.
To check if you are connected or not when this bug happen, just reload the page: the frontend will check if Esp is connected and then update the UI. I'll investigate on this bug.</li>
</ul>
