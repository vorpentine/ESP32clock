Welcome to the page of my (W.I.P.) project called <h2>ESPclock</h2>
which basically is a smart clock that connects to wifi to synchronize the time. 
At the actual state, it relies on hardcoded wifi credentials (that the user should insert in the firmware, then compile it),
then, it retrieves the time (hour and minutes) from an NTP server.

After it has synced with NTP server for the first time, it can work also in OFFLINE mode, thanks to the RTC module, which can track the time without any connection to internet.

🔜In the next release, the v2.0, user wouldn't need to use hardcoded credentials anymore, plus there would be some other features so, 
stay tuned...
